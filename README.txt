Using the mod:
--------------

This mod changes the HUD of Minetest. It adds a costum crosshair, a improved health bar, breath bar and a more fancy inventory bar. 
Also it adds hunger to the game and and hunger bar to the HUD.


You can create a "hud.conf" to costumize the positions of health, hunger and breath bar. Take a look at "hud.conf.example" to get more infos.

!!NOTICE: Keep in mind if running a server with this mod, that the costum position should be displayed correct on every screen size!!


Hunger:
This mod adds hunger to the game. You can disable this by setting "HUD_HUNGER_ENABLE = false" in "hud.conf", or "hud_hunger_enable = false" in minetest.conf. In case of conflict hud.conf configuration is dominant.

Currently supported food:
- Apples (default)
- Bread (default)
- Drawves (beer and such)
- Mooretrees
- Simple mobs
- Animalmaterials (mobf modpack)
- Fishing
- Glooptest
- Bushes

- Mtfoods

Example: 1 apple fills up the hunger bar by 1 bread, 1 bread (from farming) 2 breads in bar.
